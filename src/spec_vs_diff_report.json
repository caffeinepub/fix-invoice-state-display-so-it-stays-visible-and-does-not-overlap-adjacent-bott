  "summary": "REQ-1 asks only for complete production deployment documentation in `frontend/DEPLOYMENT.md`. The diff shows `frontend/DEPLOYMENT.md` was edited, but the visible content appears truncated/garbled and does not provide the required copy/paste-ready DFX mainnet deployment commands, Stripe admin configuration instructions with the exact backend call, a full verification checklist, or a rollback/redeploy note (at least not in the shown excerpt). Additionally, the diff includes changes/metadata unrelated to deployment documentation (e.g., `frontend-file-summaries.txt` describing numerous app/UI changes) which were not requested.",
