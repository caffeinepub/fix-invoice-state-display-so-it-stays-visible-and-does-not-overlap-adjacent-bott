# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Deploy the current draft build to production so the live app matches the latest draft state.

**Planned changes:**
- Trigger a production deployment from the current draft build.
- Verify production is accessible and reflects the same behavior/content as the latest draft.

**User-visible outcome:** The production (live) app is updated and accessible with the same experience as the current draft.
