# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Update all user-facing plan/pricing copy so Free clearly includes 10 invoices/month and Pro remains ₹299/month with unlimited invoices across key pages.

**Planned changes:**
- Update Pricing page copy to replace any “5 invoices per month” Free-plan text with “10 invoices per month”.
- Update Landing page copy (features and pricing preview) to replace any “5 invoices per month” Free-plan text with “10 invoices per month”.
- Update Dashboard plan/usage messaging so Free-plan monthly invoice limit displays as 10 (e.g., update “(3/5 invoices used this month)” to “(3/10 invoices used this month)” if keeping the same placeholder numerator).
- Verify Pro plan copy remains consistent everywhere it appears on these pages: ₹299/month and “Unlimited invoices”.

**User-visible outcome:** Users see consistent, correct plan details throughout the UI: Free includes 10 invoices/month, and Pro is ₹299/month with unlimited invoices.
